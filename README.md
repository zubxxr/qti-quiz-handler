6. **Prepare the QTI folder:**

7. **Create a Python virtual environment:**

     ```bash

     ```

8. **Activate the virtual environment:**  
   - On Linux:  
     ```bash
     source <venv_name>/bin/activate
     ```

9. **Install Pandas:**  
   ```bash
   pip install pandas

10. **Run the Script:**  
   - Make sure the path to the folder is specified.  
     ![Specify Folder Path](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16945ccd-8490-4fcf-99fd-d4776f6f705c)  
   - Then run the script. This will export a CSV file.

13. **Export as a CSV File.**  

14. **Import into the [CSV to Canvas (QTI 2.0) Converter](https://canconvert.k-state.edu/qti/):**

     ![Import Course Content](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/023d5d40-ec09-414c-b151-c9de38eac2ff)  

16. **Set the Content Type to QTI .zip File:**

      ![Set Content Type](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7bb8f82-9f25-4ebb-b139-4e149d530e1b)  

17. **Monitor the Import Progress:**  
    - Wait and check the progress of the import under *Current Jobs.*  
      - If it fails, check the CSV file you edited in Google Sheets and ensure there are no errors in any rows.
        (There may be HTML tags that are used, or images that are referenced. You must delete these rows, and manually import them into the Question Bank through Canvas later.)
      - If it is successful, it will say *Completed,* and you will see the imported Quiz under *Quizzes.*
